-> The modulo operation, represented by the `%` symbol, calculates the remainder of the 
division of one number by another. In the case of `-14 % 10`, it's asking for the remainder 
when -14 is divided by 10.

Here's how it works:
- Divide -14 by 10, which equals -1 with a remainder of -4.
- However, in most programming languages, when you perform a modulo operation with a 
negative number, the result is taken from the range of the divisor, which is 0 to 9 in this case.

So, `-14 % 10` would give us a remainder of **6**, because if you add 10 to -4 (the initial remainder), you get 6, which is within the range of 0 to 9.

In mathematical notation:

$$ -14 \mod 10 = 6 $$

This ensures the result of the modulo operation is always non-negative when the divisor is positive.
